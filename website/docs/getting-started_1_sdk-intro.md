Hi there, 👋 

Welcome to my Civ VI modding wiki, these pages have been created as a reference while wading through the challanges of modding Civ VI.

The focus is on how to mod Civ VI and the implementation challenges that this includes, tools, useful API references etc.

For the most part we will not be writing anything like basic guides on topics such as `SQL`, `XML`, `Lua` (ish) and what they are and simply focus on practical examples.

*If there is popular demand for a SQL guide then please show interest on the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/JonathanTurnock/civ-vi-modding/issues/1) but I imagine the internet could do without another guide on SQL* 😃

Feel free to raise requests in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JonathanTurnock/civ-vi-modding/issues) with the label `wish-list`

Naturally if there are any issues also raise those with the appropriate label.

Thanks and Happy Modding 👨‍🏭
