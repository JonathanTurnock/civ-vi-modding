ModBuddy is an IDE powered by Visual Studio.

It gives us an environment and provides a useful set of tools to get up and running quickly with project blueprints.

### FireTuner
The FireTuner/LiveTuner is a companion application that we run alongside CIV VI. Which provides the following:
- **Lua console** where you can execute Lua code in the running game.
- **Panels** these panels are collections of views like tables, lists, drop downs, inputs etc that are backed by Lua code.
